[Bellabeat]( https://bellabeat.com/) is a high tech manufacturer of health-related products for women. They have a range of products including water bottles, as well as fashionable jewllery and watches. Each of these products collect data that can be accessed on the Bellabeat app. This was released in 2014 for the company's first wearable tracker, Leaf, which measured step-based movement, as well as sleep cycles, hydration and stress. In 2016 the app features were expanded to include guided meditations and breathing exercises. Additionally, in 2018 Bellabeat expanded its catalog with the Period Diary app. This is essentially a menstrual cycle tracking app that allows women to track the length of their mentral cycle, period duration and symptoms.
